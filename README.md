## Installation
Current project has been saved in my personal GitHub repository and is currently available for cloning and reviews on:

https://valllerian.github.io/Planner-project/

## Usage

Main page includes the list with available input lines for each hour.
Every hour is updated with the css styling (past\present\future) depending on the time of the day.


<br>
<img alt="Main Page screenchot" src="assets/image1.jpg" />
<br>

After clicking typing in a "task" for a specific hour and clicking a "save" button
input is being saved in the local storage.
It is being pulled and shown in the input line after refresh or page load.
